# The Linker-Gendelsman Telecommunication Graphical System

Often shortened to "Telegraph" for efficiency, the LGTGS is the base hardware and language for the full Morsr product line, expected to release Summer 2018. When using the Telegraph, each letter in the alphabet is converted into "dots" and "dashes" as shown in the code block below. These codes can be displayed both visually through an LED module, audibly through a buzzer module, or physically through a vibration module.
